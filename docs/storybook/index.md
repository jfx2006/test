# Storybook

Storybook is a component library to document our design system, reusable
components and any specific components you might want to test with dummy data.

```{toctree}
running_storybook
create_story
```

## Background

The Storybook will list components that can be reused, and will help document
what common elements we have. It can also list implementation specific
components, that can not be easily reused.
